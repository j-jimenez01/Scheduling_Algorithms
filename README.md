# Scheduling Algorithms Project (CECS 326)

This project implements various scheduling algorithms in Java, including FCFS, Priority, Priority RR, RR, and SJF, as part of the CECS 326 course.

## Project Template Attribution

This project is based on a project template provided by Professor Hailu Xu for the CECS 326 course. The template served as the starting point for the project, and we have built upon it to implement the scheduling algorithms.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the scheduling algorithms:

1. **Download the Files:** Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. **Open in Preferred IDE:** Open the project files in your preferred Java IDE.

3. **Compile and Build:** Build the project if necessary.

4. **Run the Algorithms:**
   - To run FCFS, use the following command:
     ```
     java Driver FCFS schedule.txt
     ```

   - To run Priority, use the following command:
     ```
     java Driver Priority schedule.txt
     ```

   - To run Priority RR, use the following command:
     ```
     java Driver PriorityRR schedule.txt
     ```

   - To run RR, use the following command:
     ```
     java Driver RR schedule.txt
     ```

   - To run SJF, use the following command:
     ```
     java Driver SJF schedule.txt
     ```

   Replace `schedule.txt` with the path to your input file containing scheduling tasks.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to run the FCFS algorithm:

```sh
java Driver FCFS input.txt
